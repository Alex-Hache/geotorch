Real vector space: :math:`\mathbb{R}^n`
========================================================

.. currentmodule:: geotorch

:math:`\mathbb{R}^n` is the vector space of unconstrained vectors.
This class is useful when composed with other manifolds to
form more interesting spaces using the classes from :ref:`Constructions`.
