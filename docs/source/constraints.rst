.. currentmodule:: geotorch

These are the functions that form the basic interface of `GeoTorch`. They all provide a common
interface to the spaces implemented in `GeoTorch` through a common interface. For a finer control
over the underlying implementation of each space, take a look at the different manifolds.

.. autofunction:: symmetric
.. autofunction:: skew
.. autofunction:: sphere
.. autofunction:: orthogonal
.. autofunction:: grassmannian
