=====================

.. currentmodule:: geotorch

:math:`\operatorname{Gr}(n,k)` is the Grassmannian manifold, that is, the subspaces of dimension
:math:`k` in :math:`\mathbb{R}^n`. A subspace is represented by an orthonormal basis, that is, by an element
of the :ref:`Stiefel Manifold <RST Stiefel>`.
